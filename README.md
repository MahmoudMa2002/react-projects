# React Projects Collection (Vite)

This repository is a collection of small to medium **React projects built with Vite**.  
Each project focuses on practicing core React concepts such as components, props, state, hooks, and basic application structure.

All projects include improvements, such as UI refinements, better state handling, refactoring, or additional features. Any notable changes are documented inside each project’s folder.
